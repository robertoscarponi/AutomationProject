# System Identification and Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the identification and analysis of a dynamic system using experimental data. The core of the project involves processing various input signals (step, ramp, sinusoidal, square wave), estimating the system's transfer function (TF) through an iterative process, and validating the model against the experimental responses. The analysis includes both time-domain and frequency-domain assessments, culminating in a comprehensive understanding of the system's behavior.
